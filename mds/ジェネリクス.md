Generics
========

Haskell has several techniques for automatic generation of type classes for a
variety of tasks that consist largely of boilerplate code generation such as:

* Pretty Printing
* Equality
* Serialization
* Ordering
* Traversal

Typeable
--------

The ``Typeable`` class be used to create runtime type information for arbitrary
types.

```haskell
typeOf :: Typeable a => a -> TypeRep
```

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/18-generics/typeable.hs"}
~~~~

Using the Typeable instance allows us to write down a type safe cast function
which can safely use ``unsafeCast`` and provide a proof that the resulting type
matches the input.

```haskell
cast :: (Typeable a, Typeable b) => a -> Maybe b
cast x
  | typeOf x == typeOf ret = Just ret
  | otherwise = Nothing
  where
    ret = unsafeCast x
```

Of historical note is that writing our own Typeable classes is currently
possible of GHC 7.6 but allows us to introduce dangerous behavior that can cause
crashes, and shouldn't be done except by GHC itself. As of 7.8 GHC forbids
hand-written Typeable instances.

See: [Typeable and Data in Haskell](http://chrisdone.com/posts/data-typeable)

Dynamic
-------

Since we have a way of querying runtime type information we can use this
machinery to implement a ``Dynamic`` type. This allows us to box up any monotype
into a uniform type that can be passed to any function taking a Dynamic type
which can then unpack the underlying value in a type-safe way.

```haskell
toDyn :: Typeable a => a -> Dynamic
fromDyn :: Typeable a => Dynamic -> a -> a
fromDynamic :: Typeable a => Dynamic -> Maybe a
cast :: (Typeable a, Typeable b) => a -> Maybe b
```

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/18-generics/dynamic.hs"}
~~~~

In GHC 7.8 the Typeable class is poly-kinded so polymorphic functions can be
applied over dynamic objects.

Data
----

Just as Typeable let's create runtime type information where needed, the Data
class allows us to reflect information about the structure of datatypes to
runtime as needed.

```haskell
class Typeable a => Data a where
  gfoldl  :: (forall d b. Data d => c (d -> b) -> d -> c b)
          -> (forall g. g -> c g)
          -> a
          -> c a

  gunfold :: (forall b r. Data b => c (b -> r) -> c r)
          -> (forall r. r -> c r)
          -> Constr
          -> c a

  toConstr :: a -> Constr
  dataTypeOf :: a -> DataType
  gmapQl :: (r -> r' -> r) -> r -> (forall d. Data d => d -> r') -> a -> r
```

The types for ``gfoldl`` and ``gunfold`` are a little intimidating ( and depend
on ``Rank2Types`` ), the best way to understand is to look at some examples.
First the most trivial case a simple sum type ``Animal`` would produce the
follow the following code:

```haskell
data Animal = Cat | Dog deriving Typeable
```

```haskell
instance Data Animal where
  gfoldl k z Cat = z Cat
  gfoldl k z Dog = z Dog

  gunfold k z c
    = case constrIndex c of
        1 -> z Cat
        2 -> z Dog

  toConstr Cat = cCat
  toConstr Dog = cDog

  dataTypeOf _ = tAnimal

tAnimal :: DataType
tAnimal = mkDataType "Main.Animal" [cCat, cDog]

cCat :: Constr
cCat = mkConstr tAnimal "Cat" [] Prefix

cDog :: Constr
cDog = mkConstr tAnimal "Dog" [] Prefix
```

For a type with non-empty containers we get something a little more interesting.
Consider the list type:

```haskell
instance Data a => Data [a] where
  gfoldl _ z []     = z []
  gfoldl k z (x:xs) = z (:) `k` x `k` xs

  toConstr []    = nilConstr
  toConstr (_:_) = consConstr

  gunfold k z c
    = case constrIndex c of
        1 -> z []
        2 -> k (k (z (:)))

  dataTypeOf _ = listDataType

nilConstr :: Constr
nilConstr = mkConstr listDataType "[]" [] Prefix

consConstr :: Constr
consConstr = mkConstr listDataType "(:)" [] Infix

listDataType :: DataType
listDataType = mkDataType "Prelude.[]" [nilConstr,consConstr]
```

Looking at ``gfoldl`` we see the Data has an implementation of a function for us
to walk an applicative over the elements of the constructor by applying a
function ``k`` over each element and applying ``z`` at the spine. For example
look at the instance for a 2-tuple as well:


```haskell
instance (Data a, Data b) => Data (a,b) where
  gfoldl k z (a,b) = z (,) `k` a `k` b

  toConstr (_,_) = tuple2Constr

  gunfold k z c
    = case constrIndex c of
      1 -> k (k (z (,)))

  dataTypeOf _  = tuple2DataType

tuple2Constr :: Constr
tuple2Constr = mkConstr tuple2DataType "(,)" [] Infix

tuple2DataType :: DataType
tuple2DataType = mkDataType "Prelude.(,)" [tuple2Constr]
```

This is pretty neat, now within the same typeclass we have a generic way to
introspect any ``Data`` instance and write logic that depends on the structure
and types of its subterms. We can now write a function which allow us to
traverse an arbitrary instance Data and twiddle values based on pattern matching
on the runtime types. So let's write down a function ``over`` which increments a
``Value`` type for both for n-tuples and lists.

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/18-generics/data.hs"}
~~~~

We can also write generic operations to for instance count the number of
parameters in a data type.

```haskell
numHoles :: Data a => a -> Int
numHoles = gmapQl (+) 0 (const 1)

example1 :: Int
example1 = numHoles (1,2,3,4,5,6,7)
-- 7

example2 :: Int
example2 = numHoles (Just 3)
-- 1
```

This method adapts itself well to generic traversals but the types quickly
become rather hairy when dealing anymore more complicated involving folds and
unsafe coercions.


Generic
-------

The most modern method of doing generic programming uses type families to
achieve a better of deriving the structural properties of arbitrary type
classes.  Generic implements a typeclass with an associated type ``Rep`` (
Representation ) together with a pair of functions that form a 2-sided inverse (
isomorphism ) for converting to and from the associated type and the derived
type in question.

```haskell
class Generic a where
  type Rep a
  from :: a -> Rep a
  to :: Rep a -> a

class Datatype d where
  datatypeName :: t d f a -> String
  moduleName :: t d f a -> String

class Constructor c where
  conName :: t c f a -> String
```

[GHC.Generics](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/7.4.1/html/libraries/ghc-prim-0.2.0.0/GHC-Generics.html)
defines a set of named types for modeling the various structural properties of
types in available in Haskell.

```haskell
-- | Sums: encode choice between constructors
infixr 5 :+:
data (:+:) f g p = L1 (f p) | R1 (g p)

-- | Products: encode multiple arguments to constructors
infixr 6 :*:
data (:*:) f g p = f p :*: g p

-- | Tag for M1: datatype
data D
-- | Tag for M1: constructor
data C

-- | Constants, additional parameters and recursion of kind *
newtype K1 i c p = K1 { unK1 :: c }

-- | Meta-information (constructor names, etc.)
newtype M1 i c f p = M1 { unM1 :: f p }

-- | Type synonym for encoding meta-information for datatypes
type D1 = M1 D

-- | Type synonym for encoding meta-information for constructors
type C1 = M1 C
```

Using the deriving mechanics GHC can generate this Generic instance for us
mechanically, if we were to write it by hand for a simple type it might look
like this:

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/18-generics/generics.hs"}
~~~~

Use ``kind!`` in GHCi we can look at the type family ``Rep`` associated with a Generic instance.

```haskell
λ: :kind! Rep Animal
Rep Animal :: * -> *
= M1 D T_Animal (M1 C C_Dog U1 :+: M1 C C_Cat U1)

λ: :kind! Rep ()
Rep () :: * -> *
= M1 D GHC.Generics.D1() (M1 C GHC.Generics.C1_0() U1)

λ: :kind! Rep [()]
Rep [()] :: * -> *
= M1
    D
    GHC.Generics.D1[]
    (M1 C GHC.Generics.C1_0[] U1
     :+: M1
           C
           GHC.Generics.C1_1[]
           (M1 S NoSelector (K1 R ()) :*: M1 S NoSelector (K1 R [()])))
```

Now the clever bit, instead writing our generic function over the datatype we
instead write it over the Rep and then reify the result using ``from``. Some for
an equivalent version of Haskell's default ``Eq`` that instead uses generic
deriving we could write:

```haskell
class GEq' f where
  geq' :: f a -> f a -> Bool

instance GEq' U1 where
  geq' _ _ = True

instance (GEq c) => GEq' (K1 i c) where
  geq' (K1 a) (K1 b) = geq a b

instance (GEq' a) => GEq' (M1 i c a) where
  geq' (M1 a) (M1 b) = geq' a b

-- Equality for sums.
instance (GEq' a, GEq' b) => GEq' (a :+: b) where
  geq' (L1 a) (L1 b) = geq' a b
  geq' (R1 a) (R1 b) = geq' a b
  geq' _      _      = False

-- Equality for products.
instance (GEq' a, GEq' b) => GEq' (a :*: b) where
  geq' (a1 :*: b1) (a2 :*: b2) = geq' a1 a2 && geq' b1 b2
```

Now to to accommodate the two methods of writing classes (generic-deriving or
custom implementations) we can use ``DefaultSignatures`` extension to allow the
user to leave typeclass functions blank and defer to the Generic or to define
their own.

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE DefaultSignatures #-}

class GEq a where
  geq :: a -> a -> Bool

  default geq :: (Generic a, GEq' (Rep a)) => a -> a -> Bool
  geq x y = geq' (from x) (from y)
```

Now anyone using our library need only derive Generic and create an empty
instance of our typeclass instance without writing any boilerplate for ``GEq``.

Generic Deriving
----------------

Using Generics, we can ask GHC to do lots of non-trivial code generation which
works spectacularly well in practice. Some real world examples:

The [hashable](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hashable) library allows us to derive hashing functions.

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/18-generics/hashable.hs"}
~~~~

The [cereal](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/cereal-0.4.0.1) library allows
us to automatically derive a binary representation.

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/18-generics/cereal.hs"}
~~~~

The [aeson](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson) library allows us to
derive JSON representations for JSON instances.

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/18-generics/derive_aeson.hs"}
~~~~

See: [A Generic Deriving Mechanism for Haskell](http://dreixel.net/research/pdf/gdmh.pdf)

Uniplate
--------

Uniplate is a generics library for writing traversals and transformation for
arbitrary data structures. It is extremely useful for writing AST
transformations and rewrite systems.

```haskell
plate :: from -> Type from to
(|*)  :: Type (to -> from) to -> to -> Type from to
(|-)  :: Type (item -> from) to -> item -> Type from to

descend   :: Uniplate on => (on -> on) -> on -> on
transform :: Uniplate on => (on -> on) -> on -> on
rewrite   :: Uniplate on => (on -> Maybe on) -> on -> on
```

The ``descend`` function will apply a function to each immediate descendent of
an expression and then combines them up into the parent expression.

The ``transform`` function will perform a single pass bottom-up transformation
of all terms in the expression.

The ``rewrite`` function will perform an exhaustive transformation of all terms
in the expression to fixed point, using Maybe to signify termination.

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/18-generics/uniplate.hs"}
~~~~

Alternatively Uniplate instances can be derived automatically from instances of
Data without the need to explicitly write a Uniplate instance. This approach
carries a slight amount of overhead over an explicit hand-written instance.

```haskell
import Data.Data
import Data.Typeable
import Data.Generics.Uniplate.Data

data Expr a
  = Fls
  | Tru
  | Lit a
  | Not (Expr a)
  | And (Expr a) (Expr a)
  | Or (Expr a) (Expr a)
  deriving (Data, Typeable, Show, Eq)
```

**Biplate**

Biplates generalize plates where the target type isn't necessarily the same as
the source, it uses multiparamater typeclasses to indicate the type sub of the
sub-target. The Uniplate functions all have an equivalent generalized biplate
form.

```haskell
descendBi   :: Biplate from to => (to -> to) -> from -> from
transformBi :: Biplate from to => (to -> to) -> from -> from
rewriteBi   :: Biplate from to => (to -> Maybe to) -> from -> from

descendBiM   :: (Monad m, Biplate from to) => (to -> m to) -> from -> m from
transformBiM :: (Monad m, Biplate from to) => (to -> m to) -> from -> m from
rewriteBiM   :: (Monad m, Biplate from to) => (to -> m (Maybe to)) -> from -> m from
```

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/18-generics/biplate.hs"}
~~~~
