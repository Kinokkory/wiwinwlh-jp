Vector
------

Vectors are high performance single dimensional arrays that come come in six variants, two for each of the
following types of a mutable and an immutable variant.

* Data.Vector
* Data.Vector.Storable
* Data.Vector.Unboxed

The most notable feature of vectors is constant time memory access with (``(!)``) as well as variety of
efficient map, fold and scan operations on top of a fusion framework that generates surprisingly optimal code.

```haskell
fromList :: [a] -> Vector a
toList :: Vector a -> [a]
(!) :: Vector a -> Int -> a
map :: (a -> b) -> Vector a -> Vector b
foldl :: (a -> b -> a) -> a -> Vector b -> a
scanl :: (a -> b -> a) -> a -> Vector b -> Vector a
zipWith :: (a -> b -> c) -> Vector a -> Vector b -> Vector c
iterateN :: Int -> (a -> a) -> a -> Vector a
```

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/20-data-structures/vector.hs"}
~~~~

See: [Numerical Haskell: A Vector Tutorial](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Numeric_Haskell:_A_Vector_Tutorial)

Mutable Vectors
---------------

```haskell
freeze :: MVector (PrimState m) a -> m (Vector a)
thaw :: Vector a -> MVector (PrimState m) a
```

Within the IO monad we can perform arbitrary read and writes on the mutable
vector with constant time reads and writes. When needed a static Vector can be
created to/from the ``MVector`` using the freeze/thaw functions.


~~~~ {.haskell include="src/20-data-structures/vector_mutable.hs"}
~~~~

Unordered-Containers
--------------------

```haskell
fromList :: (Eq k, Hashable k) => [(k, v)] -> HashMap k v
lookup :: (Eq k, Hashable k) => k -> HashMap k v -> Maybe v
insert :: (Eq k, Hashable k) => k -> v -> HashMap k v -> HashMap k v
```

Both the ``HashMap`` and ``HashSet`` are purely functional data structures that
are drop in replacements for the ``containers`` equivalents but with more
efficient space and time performance. Additionally all stored elements must have
a ``Hashable`` instance.

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/20-data-structures/unordered.hs"}
~~~~

Hashtables
----------

Hashtables provides hashtables with efficient lookup within the ST or IO monad.

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/20-data-structures/hashtables.hs"}
~~~~

```haskell
new :: ST s (HashTable s k v)
insert :: (Eq k, Hashable k) => HashTable s k v -> k -> v -> ST s ()
lookup :: (Eq k, Hashable k) => HashTable s k v -> k -> ST s (Maybe v)
```

Graphs
------

The Graph module in the containers library is a somewhat antiquated API for
working with directed graphs.  A little bit of data wrapping makes it a little
more straightforward to use. The library is not necessarily well-suited for
large graph-theoretic operations but is perfectly fine for example, to use in a
typechecker which need to resolve strongly connected components of the module
definition graph.

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/20-data-structures/graph.hs"}
~~~~

So for example we can construct a simple graph:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdiehl/wiwinwlh/master/img/graph1.png)

```haskell
ex1 :: [(String, String, [String])]
ex1 = [
    ("a","a",["b"]),
    ("b","b",["c"]),
    ("c","c",["a"])
  ]

ts1 :: [String]
ts1 = topo' (fromList ex1)
-- ["a","b","c"]

sc1 :: [[String]]
sc1 = scc' (fromList ex1)
-- [["a","b","c"]]

```

Or with two strongly connected subgraphs:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdiehl/wiwinwlh/master/img/graph2.png)

```haskell
ex2 :: [(String, String, [String])]
ex2 = [
    ("a","a",["b"]),
    ("b","b",["c"]),
    ("c","c",["a"]),

    ("d","d",["e"]),
    ("e","e",["f", "e"]),
    ("f","f",["d", "e"])
  ]


ts2 :: [String]
ts2 = topo' (fromList ex2)
-- ["d","e","f","a","b","c"]

sc2 :: [[String]]
sc2 = scc' (fromList ex2)
-- [["d","e","f"],["a","b","c"]]
```

Graph Theory
------------

The ``fgl`` library provides are more efficient graph structure and a wide
variety of common graph-theoretic operations. For example calculating the
dominance frontier of a graph shows up quite frequently in control flow analysis
for compiler design.

```haskell
import qualified Data.Graph.Inductive as G

cyc3 :: G.Gr Char String
cyc3 = G.buildGr
       [([("ca",3)],1,'a',[("ab",2)]),
                ([],2,'b',[("bc",3)]),
                ([],3,'c',[])]

-- Loop query
ex1 :: Bool
ex1 = G.hasLoop x

-- Dominators
ex2 :: [(G.Node, [G.Node])]
ex2 = G.dom x 0
```

```haskell
x :: G.Gr Int ()
x = G.insEdges edges gr
  where
  gr = G.insNodes nodes G.empty
  edges = [(0,1,()), (0,2,()), (2,1,()), (2,3,())]
  nodes = zip [0,1 ..] [2,3,4,1]
```

DList
-----

A dlist is a list-like structure that is optimized for O(1) append operations,
internally it uses a Church encoding of the list structure. It is specifically
suited for operations which are append-only and need only access it when
manifesting the entire structure. It is particularly well-suited for use in the
Writer monad.

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/20-data-structures/dlist.hs"}
~~~~

Sequence
--------

The sequence data structure behaves structurally similar to list but is
optimized for append/prepend operations and traversal.

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/20-data-structures/sequence.hs"}
~~~~

Matrices and HBlas
------------------

Just as in C when working with n-dimensional matrices we'll typically overlay
the high-level matrix structure onto an unboxed contiguous block of memory with
index functions which perform the coordinate translations to calculate offsets.
The two most common layouts are:

* Row-major order
* Column-major order

Which are best illustrated.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdiehl/wiwinwlh/master/img/matrix.png)

The calculations have a particularly nice implementation in Haskell in terms of
scans over indices.

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/20-data-structures/matrix_index.hs"}
~~~~

Unboxed matrices of this type can also be passed to C or Fortran libraries such
BLAS or LAPACK linear algebra libraries. The ``hblas`` package wraps many of
these routines and forms the low-level wrappers for higher level-libraries that
need access to these foreign routines.

For example the
[dgemm](https://software.intel.com/sites/products/documentation/doclib/mkl_sa/11/tutorials/mkl_mmx_c/GUID-36BFBCE9-EB0A-43B0-ADAF-2B65275726EA.htm)
routine takes two pointers to a sequence of ``double`` values of two matrices of size ``(m × k)`` and ``(k ×
n)`` and performs efficient matrix multiplication writing the resulting data through a pointer to a ``(m ×
n)`` matrix.
