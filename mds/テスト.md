Testing
=======

Contrary to a lot of misinformation, unit testing in Haskell is quite common and robust. Although generally
speaking unit tests tend to be of less importance in Haskell since the type system makes an enormous amount of
invalid programs complete inexpressible by construction. Unit tests tend to be written later in the
development lifecycle and generally tend to be about the core logic of the program and not the intermediate
plumbing.

A prominent school of thought on Haskell library design tends to favor constructing programs built around
strong equation laws which guarantee strong invariants about program behavior under composition. Many of the
testing tools are built around this style of design.

QuickCheck
----------

Probably the most famous Haskell library, QuickCheck is a testing framework for generating large random tests
for arbitrary functions automatically based on the types of their arguments.

```haskell
quickCheck :: Testable prop => prop -> IO ()
(==>) :: Testable prop => Bool -> prop -> Property
forAll :: (Show a, Testable prop) => Gen a -> (a -> prop) -> Property
choose :: Random a => (a, a) -> Gen a
```

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/15-testing/qcheck.hs"}
~~~~

```bash
$ runhaskell qcheck.hs
*** Failed! Falsifiable (after 3 tests and 4 shrinks):
[0]
[1]

$ runhaskell qcheck.hs
+++ OK, passed 1000 tests.
```

The test data generator can be extended with custom types and refined with predicates that restrict the domain
of cases to test.

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/15-testing/arbitrary.hs"}
~~~~

See: [QuickCheck: An Automatic Testing Tool for Haskell](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~rjmh/QuickCheck/manual.html)

SmallCheck
----------

Like QuickCheck, SmallCheck is a property testing system but instead of producing random arbitrary test data
it instead enumerates a deterministic series of test data to a fixed depth.

```haskell
smallCheck :: Testable IO a => Depth -> a -> IO ()
list :: Depth -> Series Identity a -> [a]
sample' :: Gen a -> IO [a]
```

```haskell
λ: list 3 series :: [Int]
[0,1,-1,2,-2,3,-3]

λ: list 3 series :: [Double]
[0.0,1.0,-1.0,2.0,0.5,-2.0,4.0,0.25,-0.5,-4.0,-0.25]

λ: list 3 series :: [(Int, String)]
[(0,""),(1,""),(0,"a"),(-1,""),(0,"b"),(1,"a"),(2,""),(1,"b"),(-1,"a"),(-2,""),(-1,"b"),(2,"a"),(-2,"a"),(2,"b"),(-2,"b")]
```

It is useful to generate test cases over *all* possible inputs of a program up to some depth.

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/15-testing/smallcheck.hs"}
~~~~

```haskell
$ runhaskell smallcheck.hs
Testing distributivity...
Completed 132651 tests without failure.

Testing Cauchy-Schwarz...
Completed 27556 tests without failure.

Testing invalid Cauchy-Schwarz...
Failed test no. 349.
there exist [1.0] [0.5] such that
  condition is false
```

Just like for QuickCheck we can implement series instances for our custom datatypes. For example there is no
default instance for Vector, so let's implement one:

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/15-testing/smallcheck_series.hs"}
~~~~

SmallCheck can also use Generics to derive Serial instances, for example to enumerate all trees of a certain
depth we might use:

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/15-testing/smallcheck_tree.hs"}
~~~~

QuickSpec
---------

Using the QuickCheck arbitrary machinery we can also rather remarkably enumerate a large number of
combinations of functions to try and deduce algebraic laws from trying out inputs for small cases.

Of course the fundamental limitation of this approach is that a function may not exhibit any interesting
properties for small cases or for simple function compositions. So in general case this approach won't work,
but practically it still quite useful.

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/15-testing/quickspec.hs"}
~~~~

Running this we rather see it is able to deduce most of the laws for list functions.

```bash
$ runhaskell src/quickspec.hs

```

Keep in mind the rather remarkable fact that this is all deduced automatically
from the types alone!
