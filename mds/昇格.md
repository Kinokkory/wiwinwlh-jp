Higher Kinds
------------

The kind system in Haskell is unique most other languages in that it allows
datatypes to be constructed which take types and type constructor to other
types. Such a system is said to support *higher kinded types*.

All kind annotations in Haskell necessarily result in a kind ``*`` although any
terms to the left may be higher-kinded (``* -> *``).

The common example is the Monad which has kind ``* -> *``. But we have also seen
this higher-kindedness in free monads.

```haskell
data Free f a where
  Pure :: a -> Free f a
  Free :: f (Free f a) -> Free f a

data Cofree f a where
  Cofree :: a -> f (Cofree f a) -> Cofree f a
```

```haskell
Free :: (* -> *) -> * -> *
Cofree :: (* -> *) -> * -> *
```

For instance ``Cofree Maybe a`` for some monokinded type ``a`` models a
non-empty list with ``Maybe :: * -> *``.

```haskell
-- Cofree Maybe a is a non-empty list
testCofree :: Cofree Maybe Int
testCofree = (Cofree 1 (Just (Cofree 2 Nothing)))
```

Kind Polymorphism
-----------------

The regular value level function which takes a function and applies it to an argument is universally
generalized over in the usual Hindley-Milner way.

```haskell
app :: forall a b. (a -> b) -> a -> b
app f a = f a
```

But when we do the same thing at the type-level we see we loose information about the polymorphism of the
constructor applied.

```haskell
-- TApp :: (* -> *) -> * -> *
data TApp f a = MkTApp (f a)
```

Turning on ``-XPolyKinds`` allows polymorphic variables at the kind level as well.

```haskell
-- Default:   (* -> *) -> * -> *
-- PolyKinds: (k -> *) -> k -> *
data TApp f a = MkTApp (f a)

-- Default:   ((* -> *) -> (* -> *)) -> (* -> *)
-- PolyKinds: ((k -> *) -> (k -> *)) -> (k -> *)
data Mu f a = Roll (f (Mu f) a)

-- Default:   * -> *
-- PolyKinds: k -> *
data Proxy a = Proxy
```

Using the polykinded ``Proxy`` type allows us to write down type class functions which over constructors of
arbitrary kind arity.

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/17-promotion/kindpoly.hs"}
~~~~

For example we can write down the polymorphic ``S`` ``K`` combinators at the
type level now.

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE PolyKinds #-}

newtype I (a :: *) = I a
newtype K (a :: *) (b :: k) = K a
newtype Flip (f :: k1 -> k2 -> *) (x :: k2) (y :: k1) = Flip (f y x)

unI :: I a -> a
unI (I x) = x

unK :: K a b -> a
unK (K x) = x

unFlip :: Flip f x y -> f y x
unFlip (Flip x) = x
```


Data Kinds
----------

The ``-XDataKinds`` extension allows us to use refer to constructors at the value level and the type level.
Consider a simple sum type:

```haskell
data S a b = L a | R b

-- S :: * -> * -> *
-- L :: a -> S a b
-- R :: b -> S a b
```

With the extension enabled we see that we our type constructors are now automatically promoted so that ``L``
or ``R`` can be viewed as both a data constructor of the type ``S`` or as the type ``L`` with kind ``S``.

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-}

data S a b = L a | R b

-- S :: * -> * -> *
-- L :: * -> S * *
-- R :: * -> S * *
```

Promoted data constructors can referred to in type signatures by prefixing them with a single quote.  Also of
importance is that these promoted constructors are not exported with a module by default, but type synonym
instances can be created using this notation.

```haskell
data Foo = Bar | Baz
type Bar = 'Bar
type Baz = 'Baz
```

Combining this with type families we see we can not write meaningful, meaningful type-level functions by
lifting types to the kind level.

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/17-promotion/typefamily.hs"}
~~~~

Vectors
-------

Using this new structure we can create a ``Vec`` type which is parameterized by it's length as well as it's
element type now that we have a kind language rich enough to encode the successor type in the kind signature
of the generalized algebraic datatype.

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/17-promotion/datakinds.hs"}
~~~~

So now if we try to zip two ``Vec`` types with the wrong shape then we get an error at compile-time about the
off-by-one error.

```haskell
example2 = zipVec vec4 vec5
-- Couldn't match type 'S 'Z with 'Z
-- Expected type: Vec Four Int
--   Actual type: Vec Five Int
```

The same technique we can use to create a container which is statically indexed by an empty or non-empty flag,
such that if we try to take the head of an empty list we'll get a compile-time error, or stated equivalently we
have an obligation to prove to the compiler that the argument we hand to the head function is non-empty.

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/17-promotion/nonempty.hs"}
~~~~

```haskell
Couldn't match type None with Many
Expected type: List NonEmpty Int
  Actual type: List Empty Int
```

Typelevel Numbers
-----------------

GHC's type literals can also be used in place of explicit Peano arithmetic,

GHC 7.6 is very conservative about performing reduction, GHC 7.8 is much less so and will can solve many
typelevel constraints involving natural numbers but sometimes still needs a little coaxing.

Type Equality
-------------

Continuing with the theme of building more elaborate proofs in Haskell, GHC 7.8 recently shipped with the
``Data.Type.Equality`` module which provides us with an extended set of type-level operations for expressing
the equality of types as values, constraints, and promoted booleans.

```haskell
(~)   :: k -> k -> Constraint
(==)  :: k -> k -> Bool
(<=)  :: Nat -> Nat -> Constraint
(<=?) :: Nat -> Nat -> Bool
(+)   :: Nat -> Nat -> Nat
(-)   :: Nat -> Nat -> Nat
(*)   :: Nat -> Nat -> Nat
(^)   :: Nat -> Nat -> Nat
```

```haskell
(:~:)     :: k -> k -> *
Refl      :: a1 :~: a1
sym       :: (a :~: b) -> b :~: a
trans     :: (a :~: b) -> (b :~: c) -> a :~: c
castWith  :: (a :~: b) -> a -> b
gcastWith :: (a :~: b) -> (a ~ b => r) -> r
```

With this we have a much stronger language for writing restrictions that can be checked at a compile-time, and
a mechanism that will later allow us to write more advanced proofs.

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/17-promotion/type_equality.hs"}
~~~~

Proxy
-----

Using kind polymorphism with phantom types allows us to express the Proxy type which is inhabited by a single
constructor with no arguments but with a polykinded phantom type variable which carries an arbirary type as
the value is passed around.

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE PolyKinds #-}

-- | A concrete, poly-kinded proxy type
data Proxy t = Proxy
```

```haskell
import Data.Proxy

a :: Proxy ()
a = Proxy

b :: Proxy 3
b = Proxy

c :: Proxy "symbol"
c = Proxy

d :: Proxy Maybe
d = Proxy

e :: Proxy (Maybe ())
e = Proxy
```

This is provided by the by the Prelude in 7.8.

Promoted Syntax
---------------

We've seen constructors promoted using DataKinds, but just like at the value-level GHC also allows us some
syntatic sugar for list and tuples instead of explicit cons'ing and pair'ing. This is enabled with the
``-XTypeOperators`` extension, which introduces list syntax and tuples of arbitrary arity at the type-level.

```haskell
data HList :: [*] -> * where
  HNil  :: HList '[]
  HCons :: a -> HList t -> HList (a ': t)

data Tuple :: (*,*) -> * where
  Tuple :: a -> b -> Tuple '(a,b)
```

Using this we can construct all variety of composite type-level objects.

```haskell
λ: :kind 1
1 :: Nat

λ: :kind "foo"
"foo" :: Symbol

λ: :kind [1,2,3]
[1,2,3] :: [Nat]

λ: :kind [Int, Bool, Char]
[Int, Bool, Char] :: [*]

λ: :kind Just [Int, Bool, Char]
Just [Int, Bool, Char] :: Maybe [*]

λ: :kind '("a", Int)
(,) Symbol *

λ: :kind [ '("a", Int), '("b", Bool) ]
[ '("a", Int), '("b", Bool) ] :: [(,) Symbol *]
```

Singleton Types
---------------

A singleton type is a type a single value inhabitant. Singleton types can be constructed in a variety of ways
using GADTs or with data families.

```haskell
data instance Sing (a :: Nat) where
  SZ :: Sing 'Z
  SS :: Sing n -> Sing ('S n)

data instance Sing (a :: Maybe k) where
  SNothing :: Sing 'Nothing
  SJust :: Sing x -> Sing ('Just x)

data instance Sing (a :: Bool) where
  STrue :: Sing True
  SFalse :: Sing False
```

**Promoted Naturals**

```haskell
Value-level  Type-level         Models
-----------  ------------       -------
SZ           Sing 'Z            0
SS SZ        Sing ('S 'Z)       1
SS (SS SZ)   Sing ('S ('S 'Z))  2
```

**Promoted Booleans**

```haskell
Value-level  Type-level         Models
-----------  ---------------    -------
STrue        Sing 'False        False
SFalse       Sing 'True         True
```

**Promoted Maybe**

```haskell
Value-level  Type-level         Models
-----------  ---------------    -------
SJust a      Sing (SJust 'a)    Just a
SNothing     Sing Nothing       Nothing
```

Singleton types are an integral part of the small cottage industry of faking
dependent types in Haskell, i.e.  constructing types with terms predicated upon
values. Singleton types are a way of "cheating" by modeling the map between
types and values as a structural property of the type.

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/17-promotion/singleton_class.hs"}
~~~~

The builtin singleton types provided in ``GHC.TypeLits`` have the useful
implementation that type-level values can be reflected to the value-level and
back up to the type-level, albeit under an existential.

```haskell
someNatVal :: Integer -> Maybe SomeNat
someSymbolVal :: String -> SomeSymbol

natVal :: KnownNat n => proxy n -> Integer
symbolVal :: KnownSymbol n => proxy n -> String
```

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/17-promotion/singleton.hs"}
~~~~

Closed Type Families
--------------------

In the type families we've used so far (called open type families) there is no notion of ordering of the
equations involved in the type-level function. The type family can be extended at any point in the code
resolution simply proceeds sequentially through the available definitions. Closed type-families allow an
alternative declaration that allows for a base case for the resolution allowing us to actually write recursive
functions over types.

For example consider if we wanted to write a function which counts the arguments in the type of a function and
reifies at the value-level.

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/17-promotion/countargs.hs"}
~~~~

The variety of functions we can now write down are rather remarkable, allowing us to write meaningful logic at
the type level.

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/17-promotion/closed_typefamily.hs"}
~~~~

The results of type family functions need not necessarily be kinded as ``(*)`` either. For example using Nat
or Constraint is permitted.

```haskell
type family Elem (a :: k) (bs :: [k]) :: Constraint where
  Elem a (a ': bs) = (() :: Constraint)
  Elem a (b ': bs) = a `Elem` bs

type family Sum (ns :: [Nat]) :: Nat where
  Sum '[] = 0
  Sum (n ': ns) = n + Sum ns
```

Kind Indexed Type Families
--------------------------

Just as typeclasses are normally indexed on types, classes can also be indexed on kinds with the kinds given
as explicit kind signatures on type variables.

```haskell
type family (a :: k) == (b :: k) :: Bool
type instance a == b = EqStar a b
type instance a == b = EqArrow a b
type instance a == b = EqBool a b

type family EqStar (a :: *) (b :: *) where
  EqStar a a = True
  EqStar a b = False

type family EqArrow (a :: k1 -> k2) (b :: k1 -> k2) where
  EqArrow a a = True
  EqArrow a b = False

type family EqBool a b where
  EqBool True  True  = True
  EqBool False False = True
  EqBool a     b     = False

type family EqList a b where
  EqList '[]        '[]        = True
  EqList (h1 ': t1) (h2 ': t2) = (h1 == h2) && (t1 == t2)
  EqList a          b          = False
```

Promoted Symbols
----------------

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/17-promotion/hasfield.hs"}
~~~~

Since record is fundamentally no different from the tuple we can also do the same kind of construction over
record field names.

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/17-promotion/typelevel_fields.hs"}
~~~~

Notably this approach is mostly just all boilerplate class instantiation which could be abstracted away using
TemplateHaskell or a Generic deriving.

HLists
------

A heterogeneous list is a cons list whose type statically encodes the ordered types of of it's values.

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/17-promotion/hlist.hs"}
~~~~

Of course this immediately begs the question of how to print such a list out to a string in the presence of
type-heterogeneity. In this case we can use type-families combined with constraint kinds to apply the Show
over the HLists parameters to generate the aggregate constraint that all types in the HList are Showable, and
then derive the Show instance.

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/17-promotion/constraint_list.hs"}
~~~~

Typelevel Maps
--------------

Much of this discussion of promotion begs the question whether we can create data structures at the type-level
to store information at compile-time. For example a type-level association list can be used to model a map
between type-level symbols and any other promotable types. Together with type-families we can write down
type-level traversal and lookup functions.

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/17-promotion/typemap.hs"}
~~~~

If we ask GHC to expand out the type signature we can view the explicit implementation of the type-level map
lookup function.

```haskell
(!!)
  :: If
       (GHC.TypeLits.EqSymbol "a" k)
       ('Just 1)
       (If
          (GHC.TypeLits.EqSymbol "b" k)
          ('Just 2)
          (If
             (GHC.TypeLits.EqSymbol "c" k)
             ('Just 3)
             (If (GHC.TypeLits.EqSymbol "d" k) ('Just 4) 'Nothing)))
     ~ 'Just v =>
     Proxy k -> Proxy v
```

Advanced Proofs
---------------

Now that we have the this length-indexed vector let's go write the reverse function, how hard could it be?

So we go and write down something like this:

```haskell
reverseNaive :: forall n a. Vec a n -> Vec a n
reverseNaive xs = go Nil xs -- Error: n + 0 != n
  where
    go :: Vec a m -> Vec a n -> Vec a (n :+ m)
    go acc Nil = acc
    go acc (Cons x xs) = go (Cons x acc) xs -- Error: n + succ m != succ (n + m)
```

Running this we find that GHC is unhappy about two lines in the code:

```haskell
Couldn't match type ‘n’ with ‘n :+ 'Z’
    Expected type: Vec a n
      Actual type: Vec a (n :+ 'Z)

Could not deduce ((n1 :+ 'S m) ~ 'S (n1 :+ m))
    Expected type: Vec a1 (k :+ m)
      Actual type: Vec a1 (n1 :+ 'S m)
```

As we unfold elements out of the vector we'll end up a doing a lot of type-level arithmetic over indices as we
combine the subparts of the vector backwards, but as a consequence we find that GHC will run into some
unification errors because it doesn't know about basic arithmetic properties of the natural numbers. Namely
that ``forall n. n + 0 = 0`` and   ``forall n m. n + (1 + m) = 1 + (n + m) ``.  Which of course it really
shouldn't given that we've constructed a system at the type-level which intuitively *models* arithmetic but
GHC is just a dumb compiler, it can't automatically deduce the isomorphism between natural numbers and Peano
numbers.

So at each of these call sites we now have a proof obligation to construct proof terms which rearrange the
type signatures of the terms in question such that actual types in the error messages GHC gave us align with
the expected values to complete the program.

Recall from our discussion of propositional equality from GADTs that we actually have such machinery to do
this!

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/17-promotion/reverse.hs"}
~~~~

One might consider whether we could avoid using the singleton trick and just use type-level natural numbers,
and technically this approach should be feasible although it seems that the natural number solver in GHC 7.8
can decide some properties but not the ones needed to complete the natural number proofs for the reverse
functions.

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-}
{-# LANGUAGE ExplicitForAll #-}
{-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies #-}
{-# LANGUAGE TypeOperators #-}
{-# LANGUAGE UndecidableInstances #-}

import Prelude hiding (Eq)
import GHC.TypeLits
import Data.Type.Equality

type Z = 0

type family S (n :: Nat) :: Nat where
  S n = n + 1

-- Yes!
eq_zero :: Z :~: Z
eq_zero = Refl

-- Yes!
zero_plus_one :: (Z + 1) :~: (1 + Z)
zero_plus_one = Refl

-- Yes!
plus_zero :: forall n. (n + Z) :~: n
plus_zero = Refl

-- Yes!
plus_one :: forall n. (n + S Z) :~: S n
plus_one = Refl

-- No.
plus_suc :: forall n m. (n + (S m)) :~: (S (n + m))
plus_suc = Refl
```

Caveat should be that there might be a way to do this in GHC 7.6 that I'm not
aware of.  In GHC 7.10 there are some planned changes to solver that should be
able to resolve these issues.  In particular there are plans to allow pluggable
type system extensions that could outsource these kind of problems to third
party SMT solvers which can solve these kind of numeric relations and return
this information back to GHC's typechecker.

As an aside this is a direct transliteration of the equivalent proof in Agda,
which is accomplished via the same method but without the song and dance to get
around the lack of dependent types.
