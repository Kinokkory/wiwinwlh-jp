Network & Web Programming
=========================

HTTP
----

Haskell has a variety of HTTP request and processing libraries.

Warp
----

Warp is a particularly efficient web server, it's the backed request engine
behind several of popular Haskell web frameworks. The internals have been finely
tuned to utilize Haskell's concurrent runtime and is capable of handling a great
deal of concurrent requests.

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/27-web/warp.hs"}

Scotty
------

Continuing with our trek through web libraries, Scotty is a web microframework
similar in principle to Flask in Python or Sinatra in Ruby.

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/27-web/scotty.hs"}
~~~~

Of importance to note is the Blaze library used here overloads do-notation but
is not itself a proper monad so the various laws and invariants that normally
apply for monads may break down or fail with error terms.
