Lenses
======

There are several implementations of note that are mostly compatible but differ
in scope:

* *lens-family-core*
* *fc-labels*
* *data-lens-light*
* *lens*

**<span style="color:red">WARNING</span>: The ``lens`` library is considered by
many Haskellers to be deeply pathological and introduces a needless amount of
complexity. Some care should taken when considering it's use, it is included
here for information only and not as endorsement for it's use. Consider
``lens-family-core`` or ``fclabels`` instead.**

Should I use lens library?
--------------------------

No. The ``lens`` library is deeply problematic when considered in the context of
the rest of the Haskell ecosystem and should be avoided. While there are some
good ideas around the general ideas of lenses, the ``lens`` library's
implementation contains an enormous amount of unidiomatic and over-engineered
Haskell code whose marginal utility is grossly outweighed by the sheer weight of
the entire edifice and the mental strain that it forces it on other developers
to deduce the types involved in even the simplest expressions.

lens is effectively a laboratory for a certain set of emerging ideas, it's
idiosyncratic with respect to the rest of the ecosystem.

van Laarhoven Lenses
--------------------

At it's core a lens is a form of coupled getter and setter functions as a value under an existential functor.

```haskell
--         +---- a : Type of structure
--         | +-- b : Type of target
--         | |
type Lens' a b = forall f. Functor f => (b -> f b) -> (a -> f a)
```

There are two derivations of van Laarhoven lenses, one that allows polymorphic update and one that is strictly
monomorphic. Let's just consider the monomorphic variant first:

```haskell
type Lens' a b = forall f. Functor f => (b -> f b) -> (a -> f a)

newtype Const x a  = Const { runConst :: x } deriving Functor
newtype Identity a = Identity { runIdentity :: a } deriving Functor

lens :: (s -> a) -> (s -> a -> s) -> Lens' s a
lens getter setter l b = setter b <$> l (getter b)

set :: Lens' a b -> b -> a -> a
set l b = runIdentity . l (const (Identity b))

get :: Lens' a b -> a -> b
get l = runConst . l Const

over :: Lens' a b -> (b -> b) -> a -> a
over l f a = set l (f (get l a)) a
```

```haskell
infixl 1 &
infixr 4 .~
infixr 4 %~
infixr 8 ^.

(&) :: a -> (a -> b) -> b
(&) = flip ($)

(^.) = flip get
(.~) = set
(%~) = over
```

Such that we have:

```haskell
s ^. (lens getter setter)       -- getter s
s  & (lens getter setter) .~ b  -- setter s b
```

**Law 1**

```haskell
get l (set l b a) = b
```

**Law 2**

```haskell
set l (view l a) a = a
```

**Law 3**

```haskell
set l b1 (set l b2 a) = set l b1 a
```

With composition identities:

```haskell
x^.a.b ≡ x^.a^.b
a.b %~ f ≡ a %~ b %~ f

x ^. id ≡ x
id %~ f ≡ f
```

While this may look like a somewhat convoluted way of reinventing record update, consider the types of these
functions align very nicely such Lens themselves compose using the normal ``(.)`` composition, although in the
reverse direction of function composition.

```haskell
f     :: a -> b
g     :: b -> c
g . f :: a -> c

f     :: Lens a b  ~  (b -> f b) -> (a -> f a)
g     :: Lens b c  ~  (c -> f c) -> (b -> f b)
f . g :: Lens a c  ~  (c -> f c) -> (a -> f a)
```

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/32-lenses/lens_impl.hs"}
~~~~

It turns out that these simple ideas lead to a very rich set of composite combinators that be used to perform
a wide for working with substructure of complex data structures.

Combinator      Description
-------------   -----------------------------
``view``        View a single target or fold the targets of a monoidal quantity.
``set``         Replace target with a value and return updated structure.
``over``        Update targets with a function and return updated structure.
``to``          Construct a retrieval function from an arbitrary Haskell function.
``traverse``    Map each element of a structure to an action and collect results.
``ix``          Target the given index of a generic indexable structure.
``toListOf``    Return a list of the targets.
``firstOf``     Returns ``Just`` the target of a prism or Nothing.

Certain patterns show up so frequently that they warrant their own operators, although they can be expressed
textual terms as well.

Symbolic Textual Equivalent   Description
-------- -------------------  -----------
``^.``   ``view``             Access value of target
``.~``   ``set``              Replace target ``x``
``%~``   ``over``             Apply function to target
``+~``   ``over t (+n)``      Add to target
``-~``   ``over t (-n)``      Subtract to target
``*~``   ``over t (*n)``      Multiply to target
``//~``  ``over t (//n)``     Divide to target
``^~``   ``over t (^n)``      Integral power to target
``^^~``  ``over t (^^n)``     Fractional power to target
``||~``  ``over t (|| p)``    Logical or to target
``&&~``  ``over t (&& p)``    Logical and to target
``<>~``  ``over t (<> n)``    Append to a monoidal target
``?~``   ``set t (Just x)``   Replace target with ``Just x``
``^?``   ``firstOf``          Return ``Just`` target or ``Nothing``
``^..``  ``toListOf``         View list of targets

Constructing the lens field types from an arbitrary datatype involves a bit of boilerplate code generation.
But compiles into simple calls which translate the fields of a record into functions involving the ``lens``
function and logic for the getter and the setter.

```haskell
import Control.Lens

data Foo = Foo { _field :: Int }

field :: Lens' Foo Int
field = lens getter setter
  where
    getter :: Foo -> Int
    getter = _field

    setter :: Foo -> Int -> Foo
    setter = (\f new -> f { _field = new })
```

These are pure boilerplate, and Template Haskell can automatically generate these functions using
``makeLenses`` by introspecting the AST at compile-time.

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell #-}

import Control.Lens

data Foo = Foo { _field :: Int } deriving Show
makeLenses ''Foo
```

The simplest usage of lens is simply as a more compositional way of dealing with
record access and updates, shown below in comparison with traditional record
syntax:

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/32-lenses/simplelens.hs"}
~~~~

This pattern has great utility when it comes when dealing with complex and
deeply nested structures:

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/32-lenses/lens.hs"}
~~~~

Lens also provides us with an optional dense slurry of operators that expand
into combinations of the core combinators. Many of the operators do have a
[consistent naming
scheme](https://www.fpcomplete.com/school/to-infinity-and-beyond/pick-of-the-week/a-little-lens-starter-tutorial#actually-there-are-a-whole-lot-of-operators-in-lens---over-100).

The sheer number of operators provided by lens is a polarizing for some, but all
of the operators can be written in terms of the textual functions (``set``,
``view``, ``over``, ``at``, ...) and some people prefer to use these instead.

If one buys into lens model, it can serve as a partial foundation to write logic
over a wide variety of data structures and computations and subsume many of the
existing patterns found in the Prelude.

lens-family
-----------

The interface for ``lens-family`` is very similar to ``lens`` but with a smaller API and core.

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/32-lenses/lens_family.hs"}
~~~~

Polymorphic Update
------------------

```haskell
--        +---- a  : Type of input structure
--        | +-- a' : Type of output structure
--        | |
type Lens a a' b b' = forall f. Functor f => (b -> f b') -> (a -> f a')
--             | |
--             | +-- b  : Type of input target
--             +---- b' : Type of output target
```

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/32-lenses/lenspoly_impl.hs"}
~~~~

Prisms
------

```haskell
type Prism a a' b b' = forall f. Applicative f => (b -> f b') -> (a -> f a')
```

Just as lenses allow us to manipulate product types, Prisms allow us to manipulate sum types allowing us to
traverse and apply functions over branches of a sum type selectively.

The two libraries ``lens`` and ``lens-family`` disagree on how these structures are defined and which
constraints they carry but both are defined in terms of at least an Applicative instance. A prism instance in
the lens library is constructed via ``prism`` for polymorphic lens ( those which may change a resulting type
parameter) and ``prism'`` for those which are strictly monomorphic. Just as with the Lens instance
``makePrisms`` can be used to abstract away this boilerplate via Template Haskell.

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/32-lenses/prism.hs"}
~~~~

```haskell
_just :: Prism (Maybe a) (Maybe b) a b
_just = prism Just $ maybe (Left Nothing) Right

_nothing :: Prism' (Maybe a) ()
_nothing = prism' (const Nothing) $ maybe (Just ()) (const Nothing)

_left :: Prism (Either a c) (Either b c) a b
_left = prism Left $ either Right (Left . Right)

_right :: Prism (Either c a) (Either c b) a b
_right = prism Right $ either (Left . Left) Right
```

In keeping with the past examples, I'll try to derive Prisms from first principles although this is no easy
task as they typically are built on top of machinery in other libraries. This a (very) rough approximation of
how one might do it using ``lens-family-core`` types.

State and Zoom
--------------

Within the context of the state monad there are a particularly useful set of lens patterns.

* ``use`` - View a target from the state of the State monad.
* ``assign`` - Replace the target within a State monad.
* ``zoom`` - Modify a target of the state with a function and perform it on the global state of the State monad.

So for example if we wanted to write a little physics simulation of the random motion of particles in a box.
We can use the ``zoom`` function to modify the state of our particles in each step of the simulation.

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/32-lenses/zoom.hs"}
~~~~

This results in a final state like the following.

```haskell
Box
  { _particles =
      [ Particle
          { _pos =
              Vector { _x = 3.268546939011934 , _y = 4.356638656040016 }
          , _vel =
              Vector { _x = 0.6537093878023869 , _y = 0.8713277312080032 }
          }
      , Particle
          { _pos =
              Vector { _x = 0.5492296641559635 , _y = 0.27244422070641594 }
          , _vel =
              Vector { _x = 0.1098459328311927 , _y = 5.448884414128319e-2 }
          }
      , Particle
          { _pos =
              Vector { _x = 3.961168796078436 , _y = 4.9317543172941765 }
          , _vel =
              Vector { _x = 0.7922337592156872 , _y = 0.9863508634588353 }
          }
      , Particle
          { _pos =
              Vector { _x = 4.821390854065674 , _y = 1.6601909953629823 }
          , _vel =
              Vector { _x = 0.9642781708131349 , _y = 0.33203819907259646 }
          }
      , Particle
          { _pos =
              Vector { _x = 2.6468253761062943 , _y = 2.161403445396069 }
          , _vel =
              Vector { _x = 0.5293650752212589 , _y = 0.4322806890792138 }
          }
      ]
  }
```

Lens + Aeson
------------

One of the best showcases for lens is writing transformations over arbitrary JSON structures. For example
consider some sample data related to Kiva loans.

~~~~ {.json include="src/32-lenses/kiva.json"}
~~~~

Then using ``Data.Aeson.Lens`` we can traverse the structure using our lens combinators.

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/32-lenses/lens_aeson.hs"}
~~~~

```haskell
[13.75,93.75,43.75,63.75,93.75,93.75,93.75,93.75]
```
