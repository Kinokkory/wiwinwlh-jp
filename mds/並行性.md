Concurrency
===========

The definitive reference on concurrency and parallelism in Haskell is Simon
Marlow's text.  This will section will just gloss over these topics because they
are far better explained in this book.

See: [Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000929)

```haskell
forkIO :: IO () -> IO ThreadId
```

Haskell threads are extremely cheap to spawn, using only 1.5KB of RAM depending
on the platform and are much cheaper than a pthread in C. Calling forkIO
10<sup>6</sup> times completes just short of a 1s. Additionally, functional
purity in Haskell also guarantees that a thread can almost always be terminated
even in the middle of a computation without concern.

Sparks
------

The most basic "atom" of parallelism in Haskell is a spark. It is a hint to the
GHC runtime that a computation can be evaluated to weak head normal form in
parallel.

```haskell
rpar :: a -> Eval a
rseq :: Strategy a
rdeepseq :: NFData a => Strategy a

runEval :: Eval a -> a
```

``rpar a`` spins off a separate spark that evolutes a to weak head normal form
and places the computation in the spark pool. When the runtime determines that
there is an available CPU to evaluate the computation it will evaluate (
*convert* ) the spark. If the main thread of the main thread of the program is
the evaluator for the spark, the spark is said to have *fizzled*. Fizzling is
generally bad and indicates that the logic or parallelism strategy is not well
suited to the work that is being evaluated.

The spark pool is also limited ( but user-adjustable ) to a default of 8000 (as
of GHC 7.8.3 ). Sparks that are created beyond that limit are said to
*overflow*.

```haskell
-- Evaluates the arguments to f in parallel before application.
par2 f x y = x `rpar` y `rpar` f x y
```

An argument to ``rseq`` forces the evaluation of a spark before evaluation
continues.

Action          Description
-------------   --------------
``Fizzled``     The resulting value has already been evaluated by the main thread so the spark need not be converted.
``Dud``         The expression has already been evaluated, the computed value is returned and the spark is not converted.
``GC'd``        The spark is added to the spark pool but the result is not referenced, so it is garbage collected.
``Overflowed``  Insufficient space in the spark pool when spawning.


The parallel runtime is necessary to use sparks, and the resulting program must
be compiled with ``-threaded``. Additionally the program itself can be specified
to take runtime options with ``-rtsopts`` such as the number of cores to use.

```haskell
ghc -threaded -rtsopts program.hs
./program +RTS -s N8 -- use 8 cores
```

The runtime can be asked to dump information about the spark evaluation by
passing the ``-s`` flag.

```haskell
$ ./spark +RTS -N4 -s

                                    Tot time (elapsed)  Avg pause  Max pause
  Gen  0         5 colls,     5 par    0.02s    0.01s     0.0017s    0.0048s
  Gen  1         3 colls,     2 par    0.00s    0.00s     0.0004s    0.0007s

  Parallel GC work balance: 1.83% (serial 0%, perfect 100%)

  TASKS: 6 (1 bound, 5 peak workers (5 total), using -N4)

  SPARKS: 20000 (20000 converted, 0 overflowed, 0 dud, 0 GC'd, 0 fizzled)
```

The parallel computations themselves are sequenced in the ``Eval`` monad, whose
evaluation with ``runEval`` is itself a pure computation.

```haskell
example :: (a -> b) -> a -> a -> (b, b)
example f x y = runEval $ do
  a <- rpar $ f x
  b <- rpar $ f y
  rseq a
  rseq b
  return (a, b)
```

Threadscope
-----------

Passing the flag ``-l``  generates the eventlog which can be rendered with the
threadscope library.

```haskell
$ ghc -O2 -threaded -rtsopts -eventlog Example.hs
$ ./program +RTS -N4 -l
$ threadscope Example.eventlog
```

detailed guide on interpreting and profiling using Threadscope.

Strategies
----------

```haskell
type Strategy a = a -> Eval a
using :: a -> Strategy a -> a
```

Sparks themselves form the foundation for higher level parallelism constructs known as ``strategies`` which
adapt spark creation to fit the computation or data structure being evaluated. For instance if we wanted to
evaluate both elements of a tuple in parallel we can create a strategy which uses sparks to evaluate both
sides of the tuple.

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/22-concurrency/strategies.hs"}
~~~~

This pattern occurs so frequently the combinator ``using``  can be used to write it equivelantly in
operator-like form that may be more visually appealing to some.

```haskell
using :: a -> Strategy a -> a
x `using` s = runEval (s x)

parallel ::: (Int, Int)
parallel = (fib 30, fib 31) `using` parPair
```

For a less contrived example consider a parallel ``parmap`` which maps a pure function over a list of a values
in parallel.

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/22-concurrency/spark.hs"}
~~~~

The functions above are quite useful, but will break down if evaluation of the arguments needs to be
parallelized beyond simply weak head normal form. For instance if the arguments to ``rpar`` is a nested
constructor we'd like to parallelize the entire section of work in evaluated the expression to normal form
instead of just the outer layer. As such we'd like to generalize our strategies so the the evaluation strategy
for the arguments can be passed as an argument to the strategy.

``Control.Parallel.Strategies`` contains a generalized version of ``rpar`` which embeds additional evaluation
logic inside the ``rpar`` computation in Eval monad.

```haskell
rparWith :: Strategy a -> Strategy a
```

Using the deepseq library we can now construct a Strategy variant of rseq that evaluates to full normal form.

```haskell
rdeepseq :: NFData a => Strategy a
rdeepseq x = rseq (force x)
```

We now can create a "higher order" strategy that takes two strategies and itself yields a a computation which
when evaluated uses the passed strategies in it's scheduling.

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/22-concurrency/strategies_param.hs"}
~~~~

These patterns are implemented in the Strategies library along with several other general forms and
combinators for combining strategies to fit many different parallel computations.

```haskell
parTraverse :: Traversable t => Strategy a -> Strategy (t a)
dot :: Strategy a -> Strategy a -> Strategy a
($||) :: (a -> b) -> Strategy a -> a -> b
(.||) :: (b -> c) -> Strategy b -> (a -> b) -> a -> c
```

See:

* [Control.Concurent.Strategies](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/parallel-3.2.0.4/docs/Control-Parallel-Strategies.html)

STM
---

```haskell
atomically :: STM a -> IO a
orElse :: STM a -> STM a -> STM a
retry :: STM a

newTVar :: a -> STM (TVar a)
newTVarIO :: a -> IO (TVar a)
writeTVar :: TVar a -> a -> STM ()
readTVar :: TVar a -> STM a

modifyTVar :: TVar a -> (a -> a) -> STM ()
modifyTVar' :: TVar a -> (a -> a) -> STM ()
```

Software Transactional Memory is a technique for guaranteeing atomicity of
values in parallel computations, such that all contexts view the same data when
read and writes are guaranteed never to result in inconsistent states.

The strength of Haskell's purity guarantees that transactions within STM are
pure and can always be rolled back if a commit fails.

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/22-concurrency/stm.hs"}
~~~~

par-monad
---------

Using the Par monad we express our computation as a data flow graph which is
scheduled in order of the connections between forked computations which exchange
resulting computations with ``IVar``.

```haskell
new :: Par (IVar a)
put :: NFData a => IVar a -> a -> Par ()
get :: IVar a -> Par a
fork :: Par () -> Par ()
spawn :: NFData a => Par a -> Par (IVar a)
```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdiehl/wiwinwlh/master/img/par.png)

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/22-concurrency/par.hs"}
~~~~

async
-----

Async is a higher level set of functions that work on top of Control.Concurrent
and STM.

```haskell
async :: IO a -> IO (Async a)
wait :: Async a -> IO a
cancel :: Async a -> IO ()
concurrently :: IO a -> IO b -> IO (a, b)
race :: IO a -> IO b -> IO (Either a b)
```

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/22-concurrency/async.hs"}
~~~~
