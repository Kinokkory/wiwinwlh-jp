Interpreters
============

The lambda calculus forms the theoretical and practical foundation for many languages. At the heart of every
calculus is three components:

- **Var** - A variable
- **Lam** - A lambda abstraction
- **App** - An application

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdiehl/wiwinwlh/master/img/lambda.png)

There are many different ways of modeling these constructions and data structure representations, but they all
more or less contain these three elements. For example, a lambda calculus that uses String names on lambda binders
and variables might be written like the following:

```haskell
type Name = String

data Exp
  = Var Name
  | Lam Name Exp
  | App Exp Exp
```

A lambda expression in which all variables that appear in the body of the expression are referenced in an
outer lambda binder is said to be *closed* while an expression with unbound free variables is *open*.

HOAS
----

Higher Order Abstract Syntax (*HOAS*) is a technique for implementing the lambda
calculus in a language where the binders of the lambda expression map directly
onto lambda binders of the host language ( i.e. Haskell ) to give us
substitution machinery in our custom language by exploiting Haskell's
implementation.

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/13-lambda-calculus/hoas.hs"}
~~~~

Pretty printing HOAS terms can also be quite complicated since the body of the
function is under a Haskell lambda binder.

PHOAS
-----

A slightly different form of HOAS called PHOAS uses lambda datatype parameterized over the binder type. In
this form evaluation requires unpacking into a seperate Value type to wrap the lambda expression.

Final Interpreters
------------------

Using typeclasses we can implement a *final interpreter* which models a set of
extensible terms using functions bound to typeclasses rather than data
constructors. Instances of the typeclass form interpreters over these terms.

For example we can write a small language that includes basic arithmetic, and
then retroactively extend our expression language with a multiplication operator
without changing the base. At the same time our interpeter interpreter logic
remains invariant under extension with new expressions.

Finally Tagless
---------------

Writing an evaluator for the lambda calculus can likewise also be modeled with a final interpreter and a
Identity functor.

Datatypes
---------

The usual hand-wavy of describing algebraic datatypes is to indicate the how natural correspondence between
sum types, product types, and polynomial expressions arises.

```haskell
data Void                       -- 0
data Unit     = Unit            -- 1
data Sum a b  = Inl a | Inr b   -- a + b
data Prod a b = Prod a b        -- a * b
type (->) a b = a -> b          -- b ^ a
```

Intuitively it follows the notion that the cardinality of set of inhabitants of a type can always be given as
a function of the number of it's holes. A product type admits a number of inhabitants as a function of the
product (i.e. cardinality of the Cartesian product), a sum type as as the sum of it's holes and a function
type as the exponential of the span of the domain and codomain.

```haskell
-- 1 + A
data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
```

Recursive types are correspond to infinite series of these terms.

```haskell
-- pseudocode

-- μX. 1 + X
data Nat a = Z | S Nat
Nat a = μ a. 1 + a
      = 1 + (1 + (1 + ...))

-- μX. 1 + A * X
data List a = Nil | Cons a (List a)
List a = μ a. 1 + a * (List a)
       = 1 + a + a^2 + a^3 + a^4 ...

-- μX. A + A*X*X
data Tree a f = Leaf a | Tree a f f
Tree a = μ a. 1 + a * (List a)
       = 1 + a^2 + a^4 + a^6 + a^8 ...
```

F-Algebras
-----------

The *initial algebra* approach differs from the final interpreter approach in
that we now represent our terms as algebraic datatypes and the interpreter
implements recursion and evaluation occurs through pattern matching.

```haskell
type Algebra f a = f a -> a
type Coalgebra f a = a -> f a
newtype Fix f = Fix { unFix :: f (Fix f) }

cata :: Functor f => Algebra f a -> Fix f -> a
ana  :: Functor f => Coalgebra f a -> a -> Fix f
hylo :: Functor f => Algebra f b -> Coalgebra f a -> a -> b
```

In Haskell a F-algebra in a functor ``f a`` together with function ``f a -> a``.
A colagebra reverses the function. For a functor ``f`` we can form it's
recursive unrolling using the recursive ``Fix`` newtype wrapper.


```haskell
newtype Fix f = Fix { unFix :: f (Fix f) }

Fix :: f (Fix f) -> Fix f
unFix :: Fix f -> f (Fix f)
```

```haskell
Fix f = f (f (f (f (f (f ( ... ))))))

newtype T b a = T (a -> b)

Fix (T a)
Fix T -> a
(Fix T -> a) -> a
(Fix T -> a) -> a -> a
...
```

In this form we can write down a generalized fold/unfold function that are datatype generic and written purely
in terms of the recursing under the functor.

```haskell
cata :: Functor f => Algebra f a -> Fix f -> a
cata alg = alg . fmap (cata alg) . unFix

ana :: Functor f => Coalgebra f a -> a -> Fix f
ana coalg = Fix . fmap (ana coalg) . coalg
```

We call these functions *catamorphisms* and *anamorphisms*. Notice especially that the types of thees two
functions simply reverse the direction of arrows. Interpreted in another way they transform an
algebra/colaglebra which defines a flat structure-preserving mapping between ``Fix f`` ``f`` into a function
which either rolls or unrolls the fixpoint. What is particularly nice about this approach is that the
recursion is abstracted away inside the functor definition and we are free to just implement the flat
transformation logic!

For example a construction of the natural numbers in this form:

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/14-interpreters/initial.hs"}
~~~~

Or for example an interpreter for a small expression language that depends on a
scoping dictionary.

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/14-interpreters/initial_interpreter.hs"}
~~~~

What's especially nice about this approach is how naturally catamorphisms
compose into efficient composite transformations.

```haskell
compose :: Functor f => (f (Fix f) -> c) -> (a -> Fix f) -> a -> c
compose f g = f . unFix . g
```

recursion-schemes
-----------------

The code from the F-algebra examples above is implemented in an off-the shelf
library called ``recursion-schemes``.

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/14-interpreters/recursion_schemes.hs"}
~~~~

An example of usage:

~~~~ {.haskell include="src/14-interpreters/catamorphism.hs"}
~~~~

Hint and Mueval
---------------

GHC itself can actually interpreter arbitrary Haskell source on the fly by
hooking into the GHC's bytecode interpreter ( the same used for GHCi ). The hint
package allows us to parse, typecheck, and evaluate arbitrary strings into
arbitrary Haskell programs and evaluate them.

```haskell
import Language.Haskell.Interpreter

foo :: Interpreter String
foo = eval "(\\x -> x) 1"

example :: IO (Either InterpreterError String)
example = runInterpreter foo
```

This is generally not a wise thing to build a library around, unless of course
the purpose of the program is itself to evaluate arbitrary Haskell code (
something like an online Haskell shell or the likes ).

Both hint and mueval do effectively the same task, desigend around slightly
different internals of the GHC Api.
