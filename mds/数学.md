Numeric Tower
-------------

Haskell's numeric tower is unusual and the source of some confusion for novices.
Haskell is one of the few languages to incorporate statically typed overloaded
literals without a mechanism for "coercions" often found in other languages.

To add to confusion numerical literals in Haskell are desugared into a function
from a numeric typeclass which yields a polymorphic value that can be
instantiated to nay instance of the ``Num`` or ``Fractional`` typeclass at the
call-site, depending on the inferred type.

To use a blunt metaphor, we're effectively placing an object in a hole and the
size and shape of the hole defines the object you place there. This is very
different than in other languages where a numeric literal like ``2.718`` is hard
coded in the compiler to be a specific type ( double or something ) and you cast
the value at runtime to be something smaller or larger as needed.

```haskell
42 :: Num a => a
fromInteger (42 :: Integer)

2.71 :: Fractional a => a
fromRational (2.71 :: Rational)
```

The numeric typeclass hierarchy is defined as such:

```haskell
class Num a
class (Num a, Ord a) => Real
class Num a => Fractional a
class (Real a, Enum a) => Integral a
class (Real a, Fractional a) => RealFrac a
class Fractional a => Floating a
class (RealFrac a, Floating a) => RealFloat a
```

Conversions between concrete numeric types (from : top row, to : left column )
is accomplished with several generic functions.

         Double       Float         Int           Word           Integer       Rational
------   ------       -----         ---           ----           --------      --------
Double   id           fromRational  truncate      truncate       truncate      toRational
Float    fromRational id            truncate      truncate       truncate      toRational
Int      fromIntegral fromIntegral  id            fromIntegral   fromIntegral  fromIntegral
Word     fromIntegral fromIntegral  fromIntegral  id             fromIntegral  fromIntegral
Integer  fromIntegral fromIntegral  fromIntegral  fromIntegral   id            fromIntegral
Rational fromRatoinal fromRational  truncate      truncate       truncate      id

Integer
-------

The ``Integer`` type in GHC is implemented by the GMP (``libgmp``) arbitrary
precision arithmetic library.  Unlike the ``Int`` type the size of Integer
values are bounded only by the available memory. Most notably ``libgmp`` is one
of the few libraries that compiled Haskell binaries are dynamically linked
against.

An alternative library ``integer-simple`` can be linked in place of libgmp.

See: [GHC, primops and exorcising GMP](http://www.well-typed.com/blog/32/)

Complex
-------

Haskell supports arithmetic with complex numbers via a Complex datatype. The
first argument is the real part, while the second is the imaginary.

```haskell
-- 1 + 2i
let complex = 1 :+ 2
```

```haskell
data Complex a = a :+ a
mkPolar :: RealFloat a => a -> a -> Complex a
```

The ``Num`` instance for ``Complex`` is only defined if parameter of ``Complex``
is an instance of ``RealFloat``.

```haskell
λ: 0 :+ 1
0 :+ 1 :: Complex Integer

λ: (0 :+ 1) + (1 :+ 0)
1.0 :+ 1.0 :: Complex Integer

λ: exp (0 :+ 2 * pi)
1.0 :+ (-2.4492935982947064e-16) :: Complex Double

λ: mkPolar 1 (2*pi)
1.0 :+ (-2.4492935982947064e-16) :: Complex Double

λ: let f x n = (cos x :+ sin x)^n
λ: let g x n = cos (n*x) :+ sin (n*x)
```

Scientific
----------

```haskell
scientific :: Integer -> Int -> Scientific
fromFloatDigits :: RealFloat a => a -> Scientific
```

Scientific provides arbitrary-precision number represented using scientific
notation. The constructor takes an arbitrarily sized Integer argument with for
digits and an Int for the exponential. Alternatively the value can be parsed from
a String or coerced from either Double/Float.

Constructive Reals
------------------

Instead of modeling the real numbers of finite precision floating point numbers
we alternatively work with ``Num`` of that internally manipulate the power
series expansions for the expressions when performing operations like arithmetic
or transcendental functions without loosing precision when performing
intermediate computations. Then when simply slice of a fixed number of terms and
approximate the resulting number to a desired precision. This approach is not
without it's limitations and caveats ( notably that it may diverge ) but works
quite well in practice.

```haskell
exp(x)    = 1 + x + 1/2*x^2 + 1/6*x^3 + 1/24*x^4 + 1/120*x^5 ...
sqrt(1+x) = 1 + 1/2*x - 1/8*x^2 + 1/16*x^3 - 5/128*x^4 + 7/256*x^5 ...
atan(x)   = x - 1/3*x^3 + 1/5*x^5 - 1/7*x^7 + 1/9*x^9 - 1/11*x^11 ...
pi        = 16 * atan (1/5) - 4 * atan (1/239)
```

SAT Solvers
-----------

A collection of constraint problems known as satisfiability problems show up in
a number of different disciplines from type checking to package management.
Simply put a satisfiability problem attempts to find solutions to a statements
of conjoined conjunctions and disjunctions in terms of a series of variables.
For example:

```text
(A v ¬B v C) ∧ (B v D v E) ∧ (D v F)
```

To use the picosat library to solve this, it can be written as zero-terminated
lists of integers and fed to the solver according to a number-to-variable
relation:

```haskell
1 -2 3  -- (A v ¬B v C)
2 4 5   -- (B v D v E)
4 6     -- (D v F)
```

```haskell
import Picosat

main :: IO [Int]
main = do
  solve [[1, -2, 3], [2,4,5], [4,6]]
  -- Solution [1,-2,3,4,5,6]
```

The SAT solver itself can be used to solve satisfiability problems with millions
of variables in this form and is finely tuned.

SMT Solvers
-----------

A generalization of the SAT problem to include predicates other theories gives
rise to the very sophisticated domain of "Satisfiability Modulo Theory"
problems. The existing SMT solvers are very sophisticated projects ( usually
bankrolled by large institutions ) and usually have to called out to via foreign
function interface or via a common interface called SMT-lib. The two most common
of use in Haskell are ``cvc4`` from Stanford and ``z3`` from Microsoft Research.

The SBV library can abstract over different SMT solvers allow us to express the
problem in an embedded domain language in Haskell and then offload the solving
work to the third party library.
